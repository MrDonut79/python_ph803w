# python_ph803w
With a lot of inspiration and help from https://github.com/Apollon77/node-ph803w project I ported the basic functionallity to python with the hope and expectation to deploy it as an Home Assistant intagration without need for a docker service and MQTT.
Still a lot left to do but at least it can poll the device and show values in Home Assistant.
In desktop mode (running cyclic with lib/main.py) it performs a bit better.
